Numerical Methods involve mathematical techniques used to approximate solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. These methods are extensively used in science, engineering, economics, and various other fields.

## Main Topics in Numerical Methods

1. Roots of Equations

Solving nonlinear equations (e.g., using methods like Newton-Raphson, bisection, and secant methods). 2. Linear Algebraic Equations

Solving systems of linear equations (e.g., Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel). 3. Interpolation and Approximation

Polynomial interpolation (e.g., Lagrange, Newton's divided difference).
Curve fitting and least squares approximation. 4. Numerical Differentiation and Integration

Numerical techniques for derivatives (e.g., forward, backward, and central differences).
Numerical integration methods (e.g., Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule). 5. Initial Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

Methods like Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and multistep methods. 6. Boundary Value Problems for ODEs

Solving differential equations with specified values at boundaries using finite difference and shooting methods. 7. Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Finite difference, finite element, and finite volume methods for solving PDEs. 8. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
